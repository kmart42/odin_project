    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This simple recipe came from the Polish side of my family. We simply called it 'cottage cheese and noodles' or 'lazy man pierogies.' 
    It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. It could be a side dish, but we always enjoyed it as a meal. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 small onion (diced)</li>
      <li>16oz egg noodles</li>
      <li>16oz cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until softened, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, 
        stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
      <li>Stir butter and onion mixture, cottage cheese, sour cream, sea salt, and black pepper into the noodles. 
        Place the pot over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through and warm, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
